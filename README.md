this is just a try of mine to make a medical app where the user can put all of his/her medical details like the advisor name, fee charged, advisor's address plus the medicines that he has to take with the schedule and also the name of the medicines.
<br>
as he/she fill all the details and press the button 'all done' , all the data filled will be stored into another page , in the 'previous data' button, with the dates as the name of the list . Further inside that list they can see all the info like the names of advisor and all he/she had filled. Also the medicines with their respective schedule can be seen in a beautifull tablur format as well.

<h5>USAGE</h5>
<br>
In my mind i made this app so that the user can store all of his/her medical histories and so that he/she can also track when they got into a medical conditon the last time. This is just like keeping all of your medical data into you mobile so that you can track each of them as well
